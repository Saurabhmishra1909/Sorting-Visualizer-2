# Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer! This interactive web application allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates the fundamental sorting techniques using captivating visualizations.

## Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:** Experience the power of popular sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more. Each algorithm is visually represented, helping you understand their working principles.
  
- **Real-time Visualization:** Watch as the sorting algorithms rearrange the elements in real-time, providing a clear understanding of how each algorithm operates.

- **Random Data Generation:** Generate random datasets of different sizes to see how algorithms handle various input scenarios.

- **Step-by-Step Animation:** Follow the step-by-step animation to see how the sorting algorithms swap, compare, and rearrange elements at each iteration.

- **Responsive Design:** Enjoy a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes, allowing you to visualize sorting algorithms on desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

## How to Use

1. **Choose a Sorting Algorithm:** Select your desired sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.

2. **Set Array Size:** Adjust the size of the array to be sorted using the slider. You can choose a small or large dataset for sorting.

3. **Generate Data:** Click the "Generate Data" button to create a new random array based on your selected size.

4. **Visualize Sorting:** Click the "Sort" button to start the visualization. Watch as the algorithm sorts the array, step by step, in real-time.

5. **Reset:** If you want to try a different algorithm or dataset, simply click the "Reset" button to start over.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms

- **Bubble Sort:** A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

- **Selection Sort:** This algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning.

- **Insertion Sort:** Builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

- **Merge Sort:** An efficient, stable, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, meaning that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output.

- **Quick Sort:** A highly efficient sorting algorithm and is based on partitioning of array of data into smaller arrays. A large array is partitioned into two arrays, one of which holds values smaller than the specified value, say pivot, based on which the partition is made.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Used for structuring the web page and creating interactive elements.
- **CSS:** Styled the visualizer for an appealing and intuitive user interface.
- **JavaScript:** Implemented sorting algorithms and managed real-time visualizations.
